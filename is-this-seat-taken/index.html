She points to the television "Ohh, look it's the funny commercial you like".  Ignoring her and without making eye contact with the bar staff , he calls out "Give me the usual"  His attention still anchored at the far end of the bar. "The usual" she calls back yanking two bottles of Bud from the icy depths of the chest and popping them open in succession with a magician's flair.</p><p><b></b></p><p>"You two doin' alright, Jess" the bartender asks throwing down a cocktail napkin and setting the first sweating bottle in front of Jess. Jess grunts. "How are you doing, Sally?" the bartender asks repeating the flourish of napkin and bottle. </p><p><b></b></p><p>"OK, Leahanne -- we got a new TV" </p><p><b></b></p><p>"Ooooh, that's nice, sweetheart" patting her hand</p><p><b></b></p><p>"This is a big'un - pretty nice.

"Is this seat taken" he asked sitting uneasily beside this attractive dishwater blonde.  He talked to her like no one at the bar had ever heard him talk before.  He wanted to know as much as he could about the prettiest woman at the bar -- the occupier of his favorite spot.  Well, the prettiest woman - nearly his own age.  He had grown fond of the subtle beauty of age and the young girls in the bar held no appeal.  Besides flirting with them would make him feel like a dirty old man and Jess has some noble notions about how other people perceive him.  He also hates rejection, but he felt emboldened by Sally and felt some nod from Fate for placing her in his space. She had just moved into the neighborhood and that night was her first in Ava's Pub. As he talked to her he watched her crow's feet dance with laughter and stared deeply into her eyes. He was thankful for the change, thankful that night was the most magical he'd ever had in that place. He was a regular at Ava's and soon she became one too and his seat became her seat, there at the farthest end of the bar and he easily relocated to the second seat and from that night on, those two seats were always available as if they had their names on them.</p><p><b></b></p><p>Tonight, those irregulars were there.  Jess and Sally sit as if at center stage with the three ring circus of TV's competing for attention - his attention still fixed at the far end of the bar, and for the first time he notices the occupants are a man and a woman.  He strains to hear their conversation to read their lips. He strains against the laughter and sporadic cheers of the sport fans. He watches her laughing eyes and the man leaning ever closer to her.  They seem oblivious to the noise and people all around them, just as Jess and Sally were five years before.</p><p><b></b></p><p>Jess reaches down and touches Sally's knee.  She smiles, straightens herself in the chair and touches Jess' back her bright pink nails and pewter jewelry contrasting with the plaid. He turns to her smiling and in a moment of supernatural silence at the bar, all can hear Jess say "Babe, I love you - you know that, don't you?" </p><p><b></b></p><p>She hesitates as a tear wells in her eye. He wraps his big arms around her.  "Yeah" she says staring over his shoulder at their regular spot.</p><p><b></b></p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 data-reactid="29"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="30">Is This Seat Taken?</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
