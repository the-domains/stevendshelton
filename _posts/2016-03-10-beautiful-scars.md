in bark so

deeply traveled.

Overgrown time , indelibly

marked.

****

Touch tenderly peels

peach fuzz cheeks,

trace faint line bordering

stiff lip

skin, eroded by

emerging adolescent

torrential stream

pierced Heart

fractured limb

lame

limping

****

whole pieces

embroidered with

beautiful Scars.

****
