A union conceived of

beautiful words, beautiful words, beautiful words.

Our words.

Marched in time

'till

some words, not so beautiful fired here and there

on the battlefield, the rose thorns advance and the petals retreat.

'till..

Truces made of beautiful words, beautiful words

intercede and all is quiet on this lovers' front.

'till...

greener scenery

begs a fight again, and beautiful words in

trial, court-martial, and dishonorable discharge are

Stomped by marching boots.

'till...

the wounded, mortally so, lie still and quiet

and beautiful words come with the dawn, with the early bird's song, 

too

late

to preserve the union, the mourning doves' cry pecking about for

one last time for bits, remnants and our body of

love ... our union, torn

seceded now, struggling independent states, seeking

new alliances, common enemies, new beautiful words, beautiful words.
