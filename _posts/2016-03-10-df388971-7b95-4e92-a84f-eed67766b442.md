Double braids rest like laurel upon her head. A blend of

love and chlorine tenderly wrapped in bundled strands

****

Eyes like crystal balls reflect the past, anticipate the future

while

tiny dangling earrings delicately decorate with decorum.

... and drawn between them, thin lips arch smiling

softly like an inverted clothes line in the summer breeze.

****

Hip bones pinched between thumbs and index 

fingers yoke us

****

Appendages vine about this familiar waist and constrict.

forms merge

embrace 

evacuating

v a c u u m of 

absence.

****

Hearts squeeze tight, edges dissolve.

****

All desire branding each heart and soul, forging us

****

and this moment.. shaped in love.

****
